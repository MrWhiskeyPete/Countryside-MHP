      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">Countryside Mobile Home &amp; RV Park has been welcoming residents to the Rio Grande Valley for decades. What started as a small park in Donna, Texas has grown into a vibrant, tight-knit 55+ community where retirees, snowbirds, and year-round Texans share good times, good food, and good company.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Our tagline — "Where good friends meet" — isn't just a slogan. It's what our residents say about this place. People come for the affordable living and warm weather. They stay for the friendships, the weekly potlucks, the shuffleboard rivalries, and the feeling that they're part of something real.</p>

          <h3>Real Neighborly Spirit</h3>
          <p>This isn't a place where people keep to themselves. At Countryside, neighbors check in on each other, share meals, and build friendships that last. Many of our residents say they have more friends here than anywhere they've lived.</p>

          <h3>Valley Living at Its Best</h3>
          <p>The Rio Grande Valley offers mild winters, affordable cost of living, easy access to Mexico, and some of the friendliest people in Texas. Countryside puts you right in the middle of it all.</p>

          <h2>Year-Round Residents &amp; Winter Texans Welcome</h2>
          <p class="text-lg">Countryside is home to both full-time residents who live here year-round and seasonal visitors — the "Winter Texans" who head south when the cold weather hits up north. That mix creates a community that's always lively during the winter season and peaceful and relaxed through the summer.</p>
          <p class="text-lg">Whether you're looking for a permanent home in the Valley or a warm, welcoming place to spend the winter months, Countryside has a spot for you.</p>

      <h2>Life in the Rio Grande Valley</h2>
      <p class="text-lg">The Rio Grande Valley is one of Texas's best-kept secrets for retirees. The cost of living is well below the national average. The weather is warm and sunny nearly year-round. And the culture — a blend of Texan and Mexican influences — gives the area a character you won't find anywhere else.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">Donna sits in Hidalgo County, just minutes from McAllen, Edinburg, and Weslaco. You'll find excellent healthcare facilities, shopping centers, golf courses, birding parks, and easy access to South Padre Island for day trips to the beach. The border crossing to Reynosa, Mexico is just 20 minutes away for affordable dining, shopping, and dental care.</p>
      <p class="text-lg">It's no wonder thousands of retirees choose the Valley every year. And once they find Countryside, they keep coming back.</p>
